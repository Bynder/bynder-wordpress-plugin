# Bynder WordPress Plugin

The Bynder WordPress plugin was built as a Gutenberg Block, that allows to add assets from Bynder to WordPress using the Compact View.

# Current status

The latest version of this plugin is **5.5.6** and requires at least **WordPress 5.9** and it was tested up to **WordPress 6.6.1**.

## Implemented features

- Bynder Asset Block
  - Allows users to add an asset (document, image, video) from their Bynder account to their WordPress pages and posts.
- Bynder Gallery Block
  - Allows users to create a gallery with images from their Bynder account on their WordPress pages and posts.
- Asset tracking
  - Cron job that syncs (once per hour) the Bynder assets used in WordPress back to Bynder. This allows users to keep track of those assets through their Bynder portal.
