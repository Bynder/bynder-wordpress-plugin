## WordPress Requirements

There are currently two versions of the plugin in order to support WordPress 5.8 and earlier. The plugin files can be found in the folders named with the WordPress versions they currently support. In each folder, you will find a ZIP for the plugin and a ZIP that contains the source code if you want to make further customizations to the plugin.  

_The plugin for Wordpress 5.8 and earlier will not be actively maintained or developed on._ 

1. WordPress (Requires at least WordPress 5.9, tested up to 6.3.1)

2. WordPress-5.8-legacy (Requires WordPress 5.0 to 5.8)
